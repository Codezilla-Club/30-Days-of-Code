```
There's no substitute for hands-on experience.
But for most students, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive.
That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
```

As the number of resources may be a bit overwhelming, here are a few resources to focus on:
- From **MongoDB**, 50$ of Atlas Credits, access to MongoDB Compass and MongoDB University (certification)
- 3-month individual subscription to **DataCamp**
- 6-month subscription to **EverSQL** to optimize SQL queries
- Premium subscription to **PopSQL**, a collaborative SQL editor, while you're a student
- One Free Forever Scrapy Cloud Unit from **Zyte** for web crawling
(... and more!)
