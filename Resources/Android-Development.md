```
There's no substitute for hands-on experience.
But for most students, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive.
That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
```

- Subscription to **JetBrains** Professional desktop IDEs, to be renewed annually
- 1 year access to **Appfigures** for analytics tracking, alerts, and the complete line of App Store Optimization tools
