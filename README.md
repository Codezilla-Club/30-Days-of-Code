# Welcome to the 30 Days of Code Challenge

Hello and welcome to another one of our events! Here, we help you to hone your skills in a variety of domains through the month of March, 2022.

To do anything consistently, let alone learning everyday for 30 days straight is a challenging task! We'll help you make meaningful progress toward your end goal. In case you're facing a particular challenge, no worries! We don't want you to miss a chance to learn- our mentors are there to help you out! 

This is a great chance to build experience and grow in your own way. It's an exciting platform to discover new set of skills and different elements of programming from different domains. It is a chance to dive deep into your already existant skills.

We will also offer (optional) daily tasks to gain broader study at programming and problems.
