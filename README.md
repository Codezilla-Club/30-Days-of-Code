# Welcome to the 30 Days of Code Challenge
Hello and welcome back to another one of our events ,"30 DAYS OF CODE"!!

Here we aim to help you develop your coding skills in a variety of domains with the assistance of appointed  mentors, from 2nd to 31th January, 2022 !!

To do anything,let alone to learn how to code everyday for 30 days , in a row , with a constant amount of consistency, is definitely a challenging task ! Big or small, you`ll be making meaningful progress toward your goals — every single day.

Though we know that each and every one of you  will surely be able to solve all the challenges – in case if you are not able to find out the solution for a particular challenge, then what? No worries! We don't want you to miss out on any chance of learning, and keeping this in mind, we will be providing you with mentors that are appointed for each domain to help you reach your ultimate goal. 

If you are a beginner then,in that case it is a great experience for you to learn and grow in your own way. If not, then “30 DAYS OF CODE” is not only an exciting platform to discover new set of skills and different elements of programming from different domains, but also you get to immensely improve your already existing skills.

“30 DAYS OF CODE” will help you to unlock a brand new task every day and by offering you a more broader study at programming and problems.
